#Type-casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. Python provides several built-in functions for casting data types, which is particularly useful when you need to perform operations that require a specific type (e.g., converting a string to an integer before performing arithmetic).int(),float,bloo,str

a = float(input("number 1:"))
b = int(input("number 2:"))
c=a+b
print(c)
print(type(a),a)
print(type(b),b)
